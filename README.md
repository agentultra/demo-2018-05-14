# Demo 2018-05-14 #

I didn't really know where I was going this time. I was just messing
around with rotations the other week so I thought I'd try that again
with what I'd learned.

I'd ended up trying to go for Snake again but with a twist: rotation
and velocity around a vector instead of movement on a discrete grid.

- Time until first interaction: 20mins
